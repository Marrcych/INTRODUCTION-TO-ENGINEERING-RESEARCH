#### 1. Introductory information
Fitbit dataset: Data_IER
The MATLAB file was creating on the basis of Fitbit dataset.
It distinguishes study sample in accordance to their gender and year of study performed.

#### 2. Methodological information
Participants were asked to fill the form in which they answered questions regarding their demographics(gender,living situation,bmi).
They were asked questions regarding their attitude and specific physical activity - intense training, moderate and walking.
Then, from the reported data, each of the participants received their IPAQ score.

#### 3. Data specific information
The dataset includes:

- Demographics
- Year of data collection (2019 vs 2020)
- Expected number of steps and self-rated physical activity
- Estimate of energy use due to physical activity
- Attitude towards physical activity
- Number of steps per day (app vs activity tracker)
- Distance travelled (activity tracker)
- Calories burned (activity tracker)

A complete description of all variables can be found in the following file:

A PDF version of this description is also available on Brightspace. 


#### 4. Sharing and Access information
The students have given consent for the re-use of the data for educational purposes. Therefore the data can be used for only this purpose. Do not share the data with others.

#### 5. README for software/code
The MATLAB code was first of all used, to divide the data set into smaller parts regarding the gender and year of study.
Then, the data were used for creating tables are figure which were further uploaded in the paper.

MATLAB academic licence was used for the whole assignment. It was downloaded via TU Delft websites after logging into student's account.
For non-student users, MATLAB requires yearly subscription.

# Project title: Changes in the physical activity intensity of Erasmus University students due to the COVID pandemic with respect to gender.
Project aims to check the COVID pandemic influence on the physical activity of one of the Dutch medical school.
It compares the data gathered in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with the one made in 2020. 
The projects first tests the attitude to further focus on analysing specific activity.

## Getting Started

Please be aware that before running the MATLAB code, the Data_IER.csv from the repository needs to be in the same folder.
Also, please first import the mentioned .csv file prior to running the program.
Although, it may be weird, please run the MATLAB file 2 times!!
