# Project title: Changes in the physical activity intensity of Erasmus University students due to the COVID pandemic with respect to gender.
Project aims to check the COVID pandemic influence on the physical activity of one of the Dutch medical school.
It compares the data gathered in 2019 (pre-pandemic) with the one made in 2020. 
The projects first tests the attitude to further focus on analysing specific activity.

#### 1. Introductory information
The data analysis research was conducted for the assignment of the Introduction to Engineer Research (ME41125) course.
Database was created with the help of Erasmus University Students which then was processed into particular results.
The name of Fitbit dataset is: Data_IER.
The MATLAB file was created on the basis of Fitbit dataset.
It distinguishes study sample in accordance to their gender and year of study performed.
The paper investigates COVID-19 pandemic impact on students' physical activity.


#### 2. Methodological information
Participants were asked to fill the form in which they answered questions regarding their demographics(gender,living situation,bmi).
They were asked questions regarding their attitude and specific physical activity - intense training, moderate and walking.
Then, from the reported data, each of the participants received their IPAQ score.
Specific activity data were used for further investigation on the research topic with the help of MATLAB software.
All of the 'NaN' values in the database as well as not possibly values were deleted from the file.

#### 3. Data specific information
A complete description of all variables can be found in the following file:

A PDF version of this description is also available on Brightspace. 


Students were asked to fulfil the form giving three different types of answers:
- descriptive (gender, bmi, living situation)
- quantitative, for instance number of steps taken daily,
- in the specific range, e.g. self-attitude from 0 to 7,
- about time, in hours and minutes,


A PDF version of this description is also available on Brightspace. 


#### 4. Sharing and Access information
The students have given consent for the re-use of the data for educational purposes. Therefore the data can be used for only this purpose. Do not share the data with others.

#### 5. README for software/code
The MATLAB code was first of all used, to divide the data set into smaller parts regarding the gender and year of study.
Then, the data were used for creating tables are figure which were further uploaded in the paper.

MATLAB academic licence was used for the whole assignment. It was downloaded via TU Delft websites after logging into student's account.
For non-student users, MATLAB requires yearly subscription.

## Getting Started

Please be aware that before running the MATLAB code, the Data_IER.csv from the repository needs to be in the same folder.
Also, please first import the mentioned .csv file prior to running the program.
Although, it may be weird, please run the MATLAB file 2 times!!


### Prerequisites

Used software: MATLAB R2020b - Academic license
